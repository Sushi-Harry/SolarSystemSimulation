# A 3D SOLAR SYSTEM SIMULATION
This is a very simple Solar System Simulation written from scratch in C using OpenGL

## Dependencies
- **glfw**
- **glew**
- **cglm** for mathematics
- **cgltf** for glTF model loading
_Haven't decided what I'll be using for GUI._

## Note
I'm working on this project on linux. So can't guarantee if it'll work out of the box if you try to compile and run it right after cloning the repo.
**ON LINUX**: use your distro's packaga manager to install the dependencies and you should be good to go
